    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Tuscan salmon takes you on a trip to central Italy, with this
      Tuscan-inspired main dish. Lots of flavors you love make a bed for some
      lovely pan-roasted salmon.Everything can be done in one skillet, and if
      you'd like a side of pasta, clean up will still be a breeze. We like this
      with risotto, a salad, and a good crusty bread, too!
